    "As described in the optotagging section, identifying cells in an electrophysiological recording relies on looking for responses that are precicely synced with the laser stimuli. This notebook will go over how to align responses of recorded units to the laser presentations, calculate some metrics to determine how responsive the unit is, and then perform the same over all units collected during a session in order to assign cell type labels.\n",

    "So this animal was Adora2a-Cre (meaning it expresses Cre in D2 cells) and it was injected with two viruses: an enhancer delivering CoChR to D1 cells, and a Cre-dependent virus delivering ChRmine. From this, we can conclude that this mouse should express CoChR in D1 cells and ChRmine in D2 cells. Therefore, any cells responding to blue laser pulses are D1 calls, and cells responding to red laser pulses are D2 cells!"
