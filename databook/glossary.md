Ephys
  Shorthand for electrophysiology.

GABA
  Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain. In cortex, most GABAergic neurons are local interneurons.

GCaMP
  A family of fluorescent proteins that are engineered to luoresce when they are bound to calcium. GCaMP was generated by a fusion of the calcium binding domain of the calmodulin protein with green fluorescent protein ({term}`GFP`) [ADD CITATION]

HVA
  A <b>higher visual area</b> is a term for cortical visual areas that are not primary visual cortex, thought to be higher in the visual pathway. These include: VISl, VIsal, VISpm, VISam, VISrl among others

Neuropixels
  A family of devices for obtaining high channel count single unit extracellular recordings created through a collaborative open science project funded by Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Gatsby Charitable Trust, the Wellcome Trust, and the Allen Institute. These devices utilize modern integrated circuit design to miniaturize aspects of electrophysiology, enabling recordings of hundred of single units from a single probe with minimal brain damage. [ADD CITATION]

Ophys
  Shorthand for optical physiology, often in reference to {term}`Two-photon calcium imaging`.

Primary visual cortex
  The largest visual area in cortex that receives inputs from the Lateral geniculate nucleus of thalamus. Often refered to as <b>V1</b> or <b>VISp</b>.

Pyramidal cell
  A type of excitatory neuron with a characteristic cell body shape and apical dendrite. In visual cortex, pyramidal cells are by far the most common type of excitatory neuron.

Interneuron
  While technically an "interneuron" is a neuron that has both axonal and dendritic processes entirely within the same brain region, in the cortex the term is often used to refer to inhibitory neurons.

Basket cell
  A type of inhibitory neuron whose synaptic output targets the cell body and proximal dendrites of excitatory neurons. Many basket cells express the molecular marker parvalbumin (PV), but not all basket cells are PV+: some express molecules such as cholecystokinin (CCK). PV basket cells are typically fast spiking compared to other neurons and are thought to be important for gain control of network activity and setting the temporal precision of network activity.

Somatostatin cell
  A type of interneuron expressing the molecular marker somatostatin (SST, or sometimes SOM). SST cells tend to target the distal dendrites of excitatory neurons, and have important roles in regulating the activity of excitatory neurons.
  
Martinotti cell
  A Martinotti cell is a particular subtype of SST cell that targets the apical dendrites of pyramidal cells in layer 1. Martinotti cells are found in layer 2/3 and layer 5.

VIP cell
  A type of interneuron expressing the molecular marker VIP. VIP cells tend to target other interneurons rather than excitatory neurons. This role as a "disinhibitory specialist" is thought to be important for \ context-dependent modulation of cortical activity. Many VIP cells have a characteristic bipolar axon that points along the axis of the cortical column and are thus often called "bipolar cells".

Bipolar cell
  A subset of VIP cell with a bipolar dendritic arbor. See {term}`VIP cell`.

Neurogliaform cell
  A type of interneuron that makes a diffuse axonal arbor and is thought to release {term}`GABA` through both synaptic release and volume transmission, non-selectively inhibiting neurons nearby.

ROI
  A <b>region of interest</b> that is identified in a two photon calcium imaging movie. This is a mask containing pixels thought to belong to a neuron.

Targeted structure
  The brain region where data was collected from.

Two-photon calcium imaging
  A term for techniques which measure neural activity of neurons by measuring a fluorescent calcium indicator. These indicators are usually a protein expressed in a cell, and in some cases are genetically encoded, such as {term}`GCaMP`. At rest a neuron has low levels of calcium, and when the neuron spikes calcium flows into the neuron and raises the level of calcium. [add details about two photon imaging. Add citation to a review]

V1
  V1 is another name for {term}`Primary visual cortex`
